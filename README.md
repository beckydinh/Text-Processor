# Text-Processor

## Part A: Word Frequencies ##

* Program reads a text file and returns a list of the tokens in that file without using a tokenizer (e.g. from NLTK). 
* For the purposes of this project, a token is a sequence of alphanumeric characters, independent of capitalization (Ex. Apple, apple, aPpLe are the same token). 
* The frequency of each token should be calculated and printed out in descending order.
  
## Part B: Intersection of two files ##

* Program takes two text files from the command line as arguments and outputs the number of tokens they have in common.
